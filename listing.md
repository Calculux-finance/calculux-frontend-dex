# Pancake Swap Listing Tutorial

So, youâ€™ve come, youâ€™ve tasted our secret sauce ðŸ¥ž and now youâ€™re wanting to be a part of the PancakeSwap kitchen.

If youâ€™re interested in listing on the PancakeSwap exchange, follow this guide closely.

## Requirements

If you are seeking to be added to the [Pancakeswap.finance](https://pancakeswap.finance/) exchange, you should open a [listing request issue](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-swap-interface/issues/new?assignees=Chef-Chungus&labels=listing&template=listing-request.md&title=%5BListing%5D+Request+listing+for+%7BADD+TOKEN+NAME+HERE%7D). Someone from the team will review your application. Once it's validated, you can jump to the next step.

## Adding Tokens

3. Add your **token information** using the example format provided below to `wakandaswap.json` in the `/src/constants/token/` directory.

4. Create a **pull request** detailing information about your project, website address, and contact details (telegram)
